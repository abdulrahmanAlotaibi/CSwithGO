# What is a Computer ? ðŸ¤”
- It's your laptop or your mobile device. Or your Microwave! but let's have a concise definition of what a computer is : *any device that receives, stores, and process information*
- We have:
    - Different types of computers: desktops, servers, embedded systems
    - Different uses of computers: automobiles, graphics, finance, gaming
    - Different Manufactures of computers : Intel, Apple, Microsoft, IBM
    - Different underlying technologies and different costs

A computer consist of ðŸ’»: 

- Software
    - Operating System
    - Compilers
    - End user programs : Web Browsers, Email, Video Game
- Hardware
    - CPU, Main storage (DRAM,SRAM), secondary storage (Hard Drive, CD), Cache
    - I/O Devices : Keyboard, Monitor, Printer
- data : numbers, text, audio, video, images... (eventually it will be represented as binaries)

## Van Neuman Architecture

- So any computer may have all these things above or some of them. but we can summarize the underlying architecture as the **Von Neuman Architecture** which represent the components of any modern computer:
    - Input/output devices
        - Inputs : Keyboard, Microphone, Mouse
        - Outputs : Monitor, Printer
    - CPU : the brains of the computer, responsible of controlling the internal working of the memory.
    - Memory : stores instructions and data, they store information in binary digits or bits (0 or 1)
