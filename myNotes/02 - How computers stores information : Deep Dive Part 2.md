- types of data in the real world
    - Text
    - Numbers
    - Video
    - Audio
    - Image
- We understand now how computers store information in the form of binary digits, but how we map an image or any type of data to a binary digit ?

## Number Systems

- humans invented a system to represent quantity of things based on symbols, and these symbols are numerical symbols (0, 1,2,3...). The most common number systems are: Base 10 and Base 2
- In the human world we use base 10 to describe day to day numerical needs, and it's base 10 because we have 10 possible values 0-9 , why only base 10 not 12 or 13 ? most likely because we have 10 fingers ! so we started to count things based on our fingers.
- but in the computer world we don't have 10 possible values. remember , we only have 0s and 1s . So  the second most common number system is base 2, which only holds to possible values 0 or 1
- So any type of data, either it's an image , text, number or anything will be converted to binaries , and from binaries we could store that binary, process it, and convert it back to original human readable form whether it's audio or any other types of data
- In this illustration we can see how we represent numbers in both system (Base 10, and base 2)

### Text
- a text is just a collection of characters, and representing characters in computers happens in 2 steps
    - A way to map a character to a number
        - We use [ASCCI](http://www.asciitable.com/) for able
        - Also we use [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) table for representing all languages and and their symbols
    - convert the number to a binary

### Images
- Images are collection of colors, and representing colors in a computer happens in 2 steps
    - A system to map a color to number
        - Most common system is RGB
    - converting the number to  binary digits

### Video
- A Video is a collection of images
