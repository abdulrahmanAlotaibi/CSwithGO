# Performance Analysis Part 1: Intro 🔍
- Generally, the performance factors of a program
    - Code Algorithims
    - Languages + compilers
    - Processer (CPU) speed + Memory ⇒ how fast instruction will be executed
    - I/O and number of CPU cores
- How we can determine the performance of an algorithm.
- Or compare algorithms and determine which one is better ?
- first, we need to determine what we mean of "better"

### Experimental analysis

### Algorithms performance

- time complexity ⇒ the time it takes to execute
- space complexity ⇒ the memory it needs to execute
- We will focus on time complexity right now

### There are 2 ways to compare the complexity of algorithims

- Experimental analysis ⇒ compare the running time (benchmarking)
    - inputs ⇒ array or objects or any data
- Theoretical analysis ⇒ analyze the algorithms independently  of the implementation (software or hardware)
